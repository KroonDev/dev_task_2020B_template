```
**4. What’s the linear complexity of your solution? (approximately)**
```
Your answer...
```
**5. Can you write a unit test for the above function?**
```python
# Your Python unit tests go here
```
**6. Can you write a stress test for the above function?**
```python
# Your Python stress test goes here
```
### *Optional questions:
**1. In the initial requirements we search for terms that are contained in any part of the text. Can you change this in order to add “\*” (star character) support? For example: the search terms “full of\*” or “full of\*ness” are satisfying the results with the title “Full of happiness” but don’t match with the title “The full of darkness”.**
```python
# Your Python refactored code including the "*" (star character) support goes here
```
**2. We decided to move this code in a NodeJS project, can you translate the original function to Javascript equivalent code?**
```javascript
// Javascript equivalent code goes here
```
**3. Can you translate your refactored function to Javascript equivalent code?**
```javascript
// Your Javascript equivalent code goes here
```
**4. Can you write unit tests and stress tests for your translated Javascript code?**
```javascript
// Your Javascript unit test goes here
```
```javascript
// Your Javascript stress test goes here
```
